# My C# Cheat Sheet

This is a collection of topics I find I might need to reference in the future. The idea is to have code examples showing how various topics work.


## EntityFramework
The entity framework example is following one of the [documented tutorials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/overview/first-app?tabs=netcore-cli) for the framework. It uses migrations to create the SQLite database via the `dotnet-ef` tool that you will have to install on your system.
